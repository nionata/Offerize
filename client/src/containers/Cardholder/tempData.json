Went to the location, and was floored, the place was crowded no social distancing what so ever. No guidance from the workers nor management on social distancing of customers. I asked why no one answered the phone and was told that their policy is floor customers have priority. That’s well and good but it’s a pandemic out there! So I tried to place an order to be told that they needed to assist someone else first even though I was in line. Finally as I was standing there I noticed they were allowing individuals in the ordering area and restaurant with NO MASKS! I left... I feel god awful for the employees that have to deal with this. Grub hub workers were jumping in front of customers, again people with NO MASKS...Stay away, my lesson learned!",

I asked again and he continued to refuse to give me his name. After he left just so there was no funny business I called up to the store to explain the situation to the manager. His tone sounded as if this was not the first time he has heard this complaint; he explained he would rush a soda out to me right away.

You’re not open half the year, so I judged you to be running out of business, your counters to be dust-filled, and your ice cream to be drab. But on this especially humid day, one of the first of this summer, we decided to visit you almost as a joke. We told ourselves, “Even Rita’s can’t taste bad when we’re this tired.” “I’d eat a brick right now.” (undergrads, I tell ya)\n\nAs I stood outside the counters staring at your menu, I wondered why you would call your ice cream, a custard, and how full of yourself you must be to think Italian ice is better than any regular ice. Yet, I wanted to try both of them. The gelati seemed perfect, a choice of custard served over ice. Summer was finally here, and I’d been waiting to eat into some watermelon but here I was trying the watermelon ice and a twist custard of chocolate and vanilla.\n\nI was so tired, I didn’t complain about how unflattering your cup looked. I dug right into the custard and took a bite and I realized immediately – you were no ordinary ice cream. To make sure it wasn’t just me being dehydrated, I took another bite. So thick, so creamy. It was almost like I wanted it to just stay in my mouth. Your chocolate was just the right amount of chocolat-y and as I finished it, I was already starting to taste the ice underneath it.\n\nIt was as though the custard was just to slowly build me up to something even better, so I don’t get completely blown away. Italian ice is no ordinary ice. How could something so different from a custard, taste so good with it? You left me with puzzling questions but instead of trying to think them through, I just decided to continue eating. But you weren’t done, were you?\n\nDuring every dessert, there’s a point where you start feeling bad it’s almost over. I thought I was there but there was something creamy underneath the ice. Turns out, they had more custard underneath the ice!(!) I was probably close to tears. And I say probably only because I don’t want to admit it. I knew then, you were not just some ice cream place. You weren’t trying to make money, by feeding people. It wasn’t the custard, it wasn’t the ice. You were trying to make people happy. And for that, I’ll always come back.\n\nX\nManny",

I don’t like how they changed their menu and took a couple of the things I loved off the menu. They also tend to run out of the BEST things! Also their hot base is EXTREMELY spicy!! No matter if you get the lowest level of spicy it is HOT! I can’t enjoy my food because it’s so spicy and I always say mild! Overall it is a decent place to visit but they def need to work on making their spicy base less spicy so we can actually be able to eat and enjoy the food!!",

The food and service was not bad, but it was not that good either (dirty wine glass, service was slow and the food was served warm not hot). If we were at a diner paying diner prices no problem, but a cheese burger was $15, French dip $17 both served with below average fries. Entrees were much more, cheapest appetizers were $8. There was no kids menu, but a very small basic plate of Mac & cheese was $8, apple juice another $5. At most places you could get both for $5.\nClearly they are trying to be a upscale grill, they have a nice (but expensive) wine list, and there are some elements of the atmosphere to match (like the bathroom & live jazz), but the booths are uncomfortable and the experience does not match the advertising. Family friendly, but clearly not designed with families in mind, I assume their main customers are people staying at the hotel above, but if you are a local I would not recommend it.",

By 640 pm  Monday March 16 2020 I ordered a Garden Cobb salad for pickup which came with avocado, roasted sweet potatoes, hard boiled egg, tomatoes, red onions, blue cheese, roasted almonds, organic mesclun, chopped romaine, balsamic vinaigrette. If you order the item to be pickedup through online portal notification is given in the email of the amount of minutes a person’s order is held after the order is ready for pickup (my email gave a 30 minute timeframe). I traveled at least 2 miles from where my husband and I currently live to pick up the salad and fortunately the salad still tasted delish by the time I received it. I paid for this salad with money made from my current place of employment though I keep an open mind to both paid professional reviewers and those who write reviews for free.",

I made the mistake of not looking carefully at the site and ended up ordering through Eat Street and not the restaurant's site (I THOUGHT the site looked different but it had been a while since my last order). Anyway, I arrived to pick up my order and they had no record of it. They said they have no contract with Eat Street anymore, so it never got sent to the restaurant.  They made my order quickly but of course I had to pay them.  I got a credit from Eat Street on my credit card..PLUS Eat Street charged more for my PICKUP order.  Just make sure you use the Pizza Bolis site...learn from my mistake 😏",
